# Internship Task - Web Development

This project is a solution to the internship task for web development. The task involves creating a signup page where users can register, a login page for logging in with the provided details during registration, and a profile page containing additional user details such as age, date of birth, and contact information. The flow of the application is as follows: Register > Login > Profile.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a web application with the following features:
- Create a registration page where users can sign up with a username, email, and password.
- Develop a login page to allow registered users to log in with their credentials.
- Upon successful login, redirect users to a profile page where they can view and update their additional details.
- Ensure that the application follows specific guidelines, including separating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP code into separate files, using jQuery for DOM manipulation, implementing AJAX for backend interaction, utilizing Bootstrap for responsive design, using MySQL for storing registered data, and MongoDB for storing user profile details, among others.

## What's Done
- Created separate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP files for each functionality.
- Used jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX for interacting with the backend.
- Designed the forms using Bootstrap to maintain responsiveness.
- Implemented MySQL to store registered user data securely using prepared statements.
- Hosted the web application on Netlify for easy access.

## Note
- Please ensure to modify the database connection details in the PHP files (`db.php`, `register.php`, `login.php`, `profile.php`) according to your MySQL and MongoDB database names.
- Update the database names in the connection strings to match your MySQL and MongoDB databases.
